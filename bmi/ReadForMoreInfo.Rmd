# What is Body Mass Index (BMI)?

Body Mass Index is a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to assess 'normalcy' for body weight. It is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height. It is universally expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from body mass in kilograms and height in meters. If pounds and inches are used as a measure of body mass and height respectively, a conversion factor of 703 is used. The formula for calculation of Body Mass Index  is as under:


#### BMI = Body weight (kg) / (Height in meters)^2^ or

#### = Body weight (lb) / (height in inches)^2^ x 703



## FACTS and TRIVIA  

![](/Users\hello\Downloads\Mod9_CourseProj\bmi\www\WeightCategories.jpeg)

* Future weight of children can be anticipated by BMI.
* Losing BMI weight lowers the risk of diabetes.
* Weight of people concentrated around the middle and with a normal BMI  increases the risk of death.
* Pre-pregnancy BMI is closely related to excess weight gain during pregnancy.
* Coronary heart disease is proportionate to Body Mass Index (BMI).


### Instructions
User should input height in cm (centimeters) and weight in kg (kilograms)
The user is required to enter height in centimeters and weight in kilograms.
Please see below conversion unit from English System of Measurements to Metric System.

+ 1 pound (lbs) = 0.4536 kilograms (kg)

+ 1 stone (st) = 6.35 kilograms (kg)

+ 1 foot (ft) = 30.48 centimeters (cm)

+ 1 inch (in) = 2.54 Centimeters (cm)


> Obese individuals of both genders are at increased risk for a range of mood and anxiety disorders, but women who are even moderately overweight experience increased risks for some disorders as well. Gender is used as a selection variable in datasets that are used to provide the user some basic information about BMI. 

>Select the country of origin in order to get some data summary and plots related to BMI data available for the selected country. If USA is selected as country of origin, please select the state.  

To get the *BMI coefficient, BMI clasiffication, data summary and plots* related to the selected gender, country of origin, press the **Calculate** button, so the main panel is populated with the available data.  

The main panel is consist of 5 tabs:  

1. **Your results**, where the user is presented with BMI coefficient calculated according entered weight and height, and classification within the 5 main groups: underweight, normal healthy weight, overweight or obese.  

2. **Data summary**, where the user is presented with the mean BMI and 95% confidence interval for the mean respectively for selected country and gender, and table - the recent BMI indicators available for the selected country. The first dataset comprises data for mean BMI (crude estimate) for both genders per world countries, the second - recent BMI indicators for many countries worldwide. Datasets are pretty clean, with insignificant number of missing values just in the dataset with mean BMI crude estimates. Cleaning of the variables names is done for purpose of easier manipulation and plotting. In case there are no data for the selected country fields are left empty i.e. table is not populated.  

3. **Plot:BMI Indicators** bar plot(rCharts) of most recent BMI indicators for selected country and gender. If there are no data for the specific gender then indicators for adults are plotted. In case there are no data at all the plot is empty.  

4. **Plot:Mean BMI trend** plot(rCharts) of the trend of mean BMI crude estimates for both genders in time. Data originate from WHO Global Health Observatory Data Repository. If there are no data available for selected country, the plot is not populated.  

5. **Plot:BMI Indicators for US States** If USA of America is selected as country, then respectively the selected state in USA this tab is populated with bar plot(rCharts) of 2012 BMI indicators for adults for selected state.
